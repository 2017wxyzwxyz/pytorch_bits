Experiments for fun and education. Mostly concerning time-series prediction.

I started my experiments with [@osm3000](https://github.com/osm3000)'s [sequence_generation_pytorch](https://github.com/osm3000/sequence_generation_pytorch/) repo and some of that code still subsists in these files.

## How to run these experiments

1. clone/download this repo
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. `python experiment.py [ARGS]`

Possible arguments include...
* `--data_fn FN` where FN is one of the data generation functions listed below
* `--add_noise` to add noise the generated waveform
* `--length TIMESERIES_LENGTH`
* `--batch_size BATCH_SIZE`
* `--seq_len SEQ_LEN` the subsequence length used in training
* `--epochs MAX_EPOCHS`
* `--lr LR`
* `--layers LAYERTYPE_SIZE [LAYERTYPE_SIZE ...]` see the section on Model generation
* `--sigmoid REPLACEMENT` to use an alternative to sigmoid, this can be of the activations mentioned below, e.g. `ISRU_sigmoid`, or any function from torch.nn.functional
* `--tanh REPLACEMENT` to use an alternative to tanh, this must be one of the activations mentioned below, e.g. `ISRU_tanh`, or any function from torch.nn.functional
* `--warmup WARMUP` do not use the loss from the first WARMUP elements of the series in order to let the hidden state warm up.
* `--verbose`

## Data generation

* `sine_1` generates a sine wave of wavelength 60 steps
* `sine_2` overlays `sine_1` with a sine wave of wavelength 120 steps
* `sine_3` overlays `sine_2` with a sine wave of wavelength 180 steps
* `mackey_glass` generates a Mackey-Glass chaotic timeseries using the [signalz](https://matousc89.github.io/signalz/) library
* `levy_flight` generates a LÃ©vy flight process using the [signalz](https://matousc89.github.io/signalz/) library
* `brownian` generates a Brownian random walk using the [signalz](https://matousc89.github.io/signalz/) library

The generator produces a tensor of shape `(length, batches, 1)` containing `batches` independantly generated series of the required length.

## Model generation

The `--layers` argument takes a simplistic model specification. 

For example: `--layers LSTM_50 LSTM_60 GRU_70` specifies a three layer network with 50 LSTM units in the first layer, 60 LSTM units in the second layer and 70 GRU units in the third layer.

If the output of the last requested layer doesn't match the number of target values (for these experiments the target size is 1) then the script adds a Linear layer to produce the required number of output values.

## Layers

All of these recurrent layers keep track of their own hidden state (if needed, the hidden state is accessible via the `hidden` attribute). They all have methods to `reset_hidden()` and to `detach_hidden()`. 

`reset_hidden()` should be used before feeding the model the start of a new sequence, and `detach_hidden()` can be called in-between batches of the same set of sequences in order to truncate backpropagation through time and thus avoid the slowdown of having to backpropagate through to the beginning of the entire sequence.

Moreover they all take input of shape `(seq_len, batch_size, features)`. This allows vectorising any calculations that don't depend on the hidden state.

* LSTM - the typical LSTM adapted from the PyTorch source code for LSTMCell.
* GRU - the typical GRU adapted from the PyTorch source code for GRUCell.
* MGU and variants - from [arxiv:Minimal Gated Unit for Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09420) and simplified in [arxiv:Simplified Minimal Gated Unit Variations for Recurrent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03452). I have only coded the original MGU and MGU2 variant because they say it is the best of the three.
* RAN - the [arxiv:Recurrent Additive Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07393)
* SRU - the Simple Recurrent Unit from [arxiv:Training RNNs as fast as CNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02755v3). They provide a cuda optimised implementation. This is a simplistic implementation that vectorises the calculation of the gates. In my experience, vectorising the calculation of the gates can slow down the SRU if the `hidden_size` and `batch_size` are really small, for example `hidden_size` = 50 and `batch_size` = 10. I don't know why.
* CausalConv1d - a wrapper for Conv1d that permutes the input shape to that required by Conv1d, and adds the padding that ensures that each timestep sees no future inputs.
* QRNN - an unoptimised implementation of [arxiv:Quasi-recurrent neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01576v2) The paper makes the QRNN seem rather complex, but when you write out the step equations you see that it is not very different from most other RNNs.

### Planned

* Strongly typed LSTM and GRU from [arxiv:Strongly-Typed Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02218)

### Ideas/research

* I plan to study [arxiv:Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05043), but for the moment it is not clear to me how best to implement it.
* Optional noisy initial hidden states. Otherwise the model will learn to cope with the fact of having zero initial hidden state which may hinder learning the hidden state dynamics later in the sequences. This probably isn't very important if I have only a few sequences that are very long and that are normalised to zero mean.
* The LSTM class in PyTorch builds a configurable number of identically sized LSTM layers. This architecture allows us to calculate W x h_tm1 for all layers in one single operation. I may try adapting the above layers to take advantage of this.

## Optimisers

* COCOB - COntinuous COin Betting from [arxiv:Training Deep Networks without Learning Rates Through Coin Betting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07795)
* Adam_HD - Adam with Hypergradient descent from [arxiv:Online Learning Rate Adaptation with Hypergradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04782) I have set the learning rate's learning rate to 0.1 which is much higher than they recommend, but it works well for the experiments I have run.

### Planned

* ADINE - ADaptive INErtia from [arxiv:ADINE: An Adaptive Momentum Method for Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07424)
* PowerSign optimizer from https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07417 : lr * g * e ^ (sign(g) * sign(EMA(.9)(g)))

## Activations

* ISRLU - [arxiv:Improving Deep Learning by Inverse Square Root Linear Units (ISRLUs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09967) An alternative to ELU that ought to be faster to calculate.
* ISRU_tanh - from the same paper. A proposed alternative to tanh.
* ISRU_sigmoid - from the same paper. A proposed alternative to sigmoid.

## Regularisers

### Planned

* DARC1 regularizer from https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05468
